  "description": "Introduce a new feature called 'batch count'. The batch count is the number of times the workflow will be run when 'generate' is pressed. Note that each individual run of the workflow might generate multiple images, so the gallery at then end should show all images generated by all iterations of the workflow. The seed used for each iteration should be a random function derived from the actual base seed value. That way, the iterations will be reproducible from a seed but the output for each iteration will not be identical"
